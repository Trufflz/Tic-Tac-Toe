# Tic Tac Toe
This was my very first Hackathon Project submitted to RoseHack 2022 @ UCR. As we were in quarantine from the pandemic and could not meet in person, I used this opportunity along with my friend Ben Nguyen to learn how to collaborate on code using Git and Github.

Two players are first asked to enter their usernames to battle it out in a well-mannered, fairly fought game of tic tac toe! The program outputs a tic tac toe board as well as the person's username and associated symbol on the board. The user then inputs their symbol, and the board is outputted again, this time updated with the previous move. Now, the program asks for the next player's move, and this process repeats until the program detects 3 same symbols in a row, in which it'll declare the specific user victorious. If no moves are found to have 3 similar symbols in a row, the program will terminate in a draw.
